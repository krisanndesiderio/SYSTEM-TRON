COVID19-Case Surveillance Public Use Data

# Introduction

COVID-19 is the largest public health crisis the U.S. has faced in the last century, and timely and accurate surveillance data are imperative to inform prevention strategies, health policies, and resource allocations for local and national responses.

As the pandemic evolved and the need for ongoing, sustainable national case surveillance data became evident, CDC built on the existing National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), which has provided case surveillance data for decades. As a result of ongoing analyses of national COVID-19 case surveillance data, the US response has been guided in identifying disproportionately affected populations. Case surveillance data have been used to monitor disease incidence, identify underlying medical conditions associated with the disease, and offer guidance on prevention.

Summarizing the purpose, limitations, and completeness of national COVID-19 case surveillance data may help improve these data over time and aid in their interpretation. To describe regional variations in estimated sensitivity of case ascertainment and completeness in COVID-19 case surveillance data, we compared counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths from case surveillance data with aggregate counts of cases and deaths compiled by CDC from jurisdictions during April 5–September 30, 2020. We also analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in the proportion of cases with complete data on selected demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes



# Statement of the Problem

This study was carried out to analyze Covid-19 data, which may help us determine how cases and surveillance improve from time to time in the midst of the pandemic.

The following questions will be the sole focus of this research:

1.) What exactly is a covid-19 case, including a "probable case?"

2.) How important is data tracker in determining covid-19 cases on a regular basis?

3.) How can data sources support in the gathering of information on Covid-19 cases?

4.) What are the limitations of using case surveillance data to gather information on Covid-19 cases?


# Significance of the Problem 

The present study is significant to the following personnel involved in the system of the Alitagtag, Batangas:

To the Government, this will be used as the  medium to help officials understand where, when, and in which populations an illness is transmitted.

To the Public Health Office, this study will be a good way to meet the goal of the hospitals, healthcare providers and laboratories. 

To the patients, it will help them to protect from infectious diseases especially the COVID-19 and other health threats. 

To the future researchers, they will be benefited with the study because there will be another reference for their future research.



# Expected Output

The expected output of our topic entitled COVID19-Case Surveillance Public Use Data. 

As the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, routine identification and dissemination of priority COVID-19 public health science questions can promote efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health partners to fill critical scientific gaps and inform evidence-based decision-making through public health surveillance and epidemiologic research. 

The priority questions outline the critical scientific gaps identified by the CDC COVID-19 Response, CDC programs, and other public health partners that, if addressed, could provide significant, timely, and measurable improvements in public health outcomes.
