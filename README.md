# Introduction

COVID-19 is not only a global pandemic and public health crisis that emerged last 2019, but it has also had a significant impact on the global economy and markets, including establishments and other businesses where we, the people, used to go.This virus outbreak has been therefor a long time, yet we are still in the grip of a pandemic.

According to Teutsch, S. (2000), public health surveillance is the systematic, ongoing assessment of the health of a community, based on the collection, interpretation, and use of health data. Surveillance provides information necessary for public health decision making. This text presents an organized approach to planning, developing, and implementing public health surveillance systems.
As the pandemic evolved and the need for ongoing, sustainable national case surveillance data became evident, CDC built on the existing National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), which has provided case surveillance data for decades. As a result of ongoing analyses of national COVID-19 case surveillance data, the US response has been guided in identifying disproportionately affected populations. Case surveillance data have been used to monitor disease incidence, identify underlying medical conditions associated with the disease, and offer guidance on prevention.

Summarizing the objective, constraints, and completeness of national COVID-19 case surveillance data could assist enhance and analyze these data over time. We compared counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths from case surveillance data with aggregate counts of cases and deaths compiled by the CDC from jurisdictions between April 5 and September 30, 2020, to describe regional variations in estimated sensitivity of case ascertainment and completeness in COVID-19 case surveillance data. We also looked at case surveillance data to see if there were any geographic or temporal trends in the proportion of cases with complete information on demographics, underlying medical problems, and outcomes.

# Statement of the Problem

This study was carried out to analyze Covid-19 data, which may help us determine how cases and surveillance improve from time to time in the midst of the pandemic.

The following questions will be the sole focus of this research:

1.) What exactly is a covid-19 case, including a "probable case?"

2.) How important is data tracker in determining covid-19 cases on a regular basis?

3.) How can data sources support in the gathering of information on Covid-19 cases?

4.) What are the limitations of using case surveillance data to gather information on Covid-19 cases?


# Significance of the Problem 

The present study is significant to the following personnel involved in the system of the Alitagtag, Batangas:

To the Government, this will be used as the  medium to help officials understand where, when, and in which populations an illness is transmitted.

To the Public Health Office, this study will be a good way to meet the goal of the hospitals, healthcare providers and laboratories. 

To the patients, it will help them to protect from infectious diseases especially the COVID-19 and other health threats. 

To the future researchers, they will be benefited with the study because there will be another reference for their future research.

# Methods

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC has maintained a count of US cases and deaths by both aggregate and individual means (case surveillance). The CDC collects aggregate counts from jurisdiction websites using both manual and automated means, including a survey of jurisdiction on a daily basis. This is done by calculating the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths occurring in each jurisdiction per day and publishing the information online. During the pandemic, the process of gathering case surveillance data changed (supplementary figure available from authors upon request). To facilitate data gathering from jurisdictions, the CDC initiated an outbreak response database beginning January 22, 2020. The researchers analyzed case surveillance data to determine the proportion of case surveillance records with complete information on selected characteristics, such as demographics, underlying medical conditions, symptoms, and outcome per month by HHS region. And also conducted analysis as part of public health surveillance activities, and CDC determined this project to be exempt from human subjects approval.


# Expected Output

The expected output of our topic entitled COVID19-Case Surveillance Public Use Data. 

Regular identification and dissemination of priority covid-19 science questions for public health will help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its partners in public health fill critical science gaps and make decision evidence by looking at pandemic health of covid-19 altering

Reveals the priority questions the key scientists identified by the CDC COVID-19 programs for the CDC and other public health stakeholders to be addressed. often result in casual, timely and consistent improvements that can improve public health outcomes.
